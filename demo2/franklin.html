    Franklin Clinton is a character in the Grand Theft Auto series who appears as one of the three protagonists in Grand Theft Auto V, along with Michael De Santa and Trevor Philips, and appears as a main character in Grand Theft Auto Online as part of The Contract update, also appearing as one of the two playable characters of the Short Trips mission series and the Double Down Adversary Modes, along with Lamar Davis.

Franklin was born and lived his entire life in Los Santos. He became a gangbanger at a young age and joined The Families alongside his best friend Lamar Davis, committing various small crimes for a living. Franklin's story revolves around his desire to become something more and make something of himself, which he succeeds when he meets Michael, who becomes a mentor figure to him and recruits him in all of his robberies and various jobs for other criminals, leading to Franklin's eventual success and wealth. Franklin also befriends the third protagonist, Trevor, who, although not as close to him as Michael, still becomes somewhat of a mentor for him.

He was also briefly mentioned in Grand Theft Auto Online by Lamar Davis in the missions "Mall or Nothing" and "Community Outreach" and by Hao recalling "Shift Work" during the LS Car Meet introduction. He is later introduced as a successful entrepreneur and multi-millionaire by 2021, who owns the F. Clinton and Partner agency with his new partner, the GTA Online Protagonist.

He is voiced by Shawn Fonteno, who is the cousin of Young Maylay, the voice actor of Carl Johnson, the protagonist of Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas.
