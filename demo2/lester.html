    Lester suffers from a wasting disease which has gradually worn down his motor skills during his life and left him wheelchair-bound, though he is able to walk short distances with the use of a cane. Due to his limited mobility, Lester has grown considerably overweight, and he also suffers from asthma. It is implied that Lester was bullied in high school, as he posted on Bleeter that "getting revenge" on his old high school class "never seemed to get old".

Some time after he finished his studies, Lester applied for a faculty position at the University of San Andreas, Los Santos, but was not accepted. As an act of revenge, he hacked their systems. [1]

At an unknown point in time, Lester met and became affiliated with bank robbers Michael Townley and Trevor Philips, becoming a regular member of their heist crews since the start of their partnership, working mostly as a planner and information scout. In 2004, Lester refused to participate in robbing a cash storage facility in Ludendorff, North Yankton, believing it was a bad idea. His suspicions are later confirmed when he discovers that, during this same heist, Michael was apparently gunned down and another associate, Brad, was subsequently arrested.

Following the botched heist, Lester moved to Los Santos, and purchased a garment factory in La Mesa, along with several other properties to use as fronts for his various operations. During this time, Lester looked into the heist and learned that Michael was alive, but had faked his death and moved to Los Santos, having previously made a deal with Federal Investigation Bureau agent Dave Norton, but as Michael never mentioned him as part of the crew, he kept quiet about Michael's secret. After this, Michael, Trevor, and Lester lost contact with each other, though Lester secretly kept tabs on Michael and Trevor's whereabouts.
